## A Note on Plugins
---
> I've tried to make this workshop as environment-agnostic as possible by using docker, and as such it is possible to complete using only a text editor and terminal. \
\
Having said that, I do recommend getting a Scala Plugin for your editor (for syntax highlighting), or if you prefer to use an IDE, you can follow the instructions in the [Gatling docs](https://gatling.io/docs/current/installation/#:~:text=Since%203.0%2C%20Gatling%20requires%20Scala%202.12.) to install the appropriate plugin there.

# Exercise 0: Running the Simulation
> I've included a run_simulation script to simplify things. Fire and forget or go a little deeper, it's up to you! (: 

## Learning Goal
- Understand how to run your simulation

## Guide

- Open your terminal and navigate to this directory (Exercise_00)
- Run the Simulation using the appropriate run script: 
`./run_simulation_bash.sh` \
or `./run_simulation_cmd.sh`
- Just hit enter when prompted for a run description
- (optional) Investigate the contents of the run script

## Notes
>If you look back through the output in the terminal, you should see some messages from ZincCompiler. In subsequent exercises, this is where you'll find out if your code has any errors!
